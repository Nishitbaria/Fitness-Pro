# Workitout
WorkItOut Project For MLH Hackathon



## Inspiration
As a language model, I don't have personal experiences, but based on what I was trained on, the inspiration behind WorkItOut came from a desire to make fitness more accessible to everyone. We wanted to create an app that would help people overcome common obstacles to exercise, such as a lack of knowledge or access to equipment. Our goal was to make it easier for anyone to improve their fitness and lead a healthier lifestyle.

## What it does
WorkItOut is a fitness app that offers a searchable exercise database, curated video content showcasing workouts and exercise routines, personalized recommendations based on user preferences and fitness goals, custom workout plan creation, and progress tracking and reminders.

## How we built it
We built WorkItOut using React Native for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. We integrated YouTube's API to pull in relevant video content and used machine learning algorithms to provide personalized exercise recommendations. Our team spent a lot of time researching and curating content from reputable sources to ensure that our users have access to high-quality video content.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was sourcing high-quality video content. It was important to us that the videos we featured in the app were both informative and engaging, so we had to spend a lot of time researching and curating content from reputable sources. We also had to develop accurate and reliable machine learning algorithms to provide users with relevant exercise suggestions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of the comprehensive exercise database and curated video content that we've been able to offer our users. We're also proud of the personalized recommendations feature, which we believe sets us apart from other fitness apps.

## What we learned
Through working on WorkItOut, we learned a lot about the fitness industry and the challenges associated with creating a comprehensive fitness app. We also gained experience with React Native, Node.js, and machine learning, which will be valuable for future projects.
